# NLP-Machine-Translation-Project

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains all datasets.
  - `raw/`: Original downloaded datasets.
  - `processed/`: Cleaned and tokenized data ready for training.
- **src/**: Source code for the project.
  - `preprocessing/`: Scripts for data cleaning and preparation.
  - `training/`: Scripts for model training and fine-tuning.
  - `evaluation/`: Scripts for evaluating model performance (e.g., ROUGE scores).
  - `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation.
- **models/**: Saved models and checkpoints.
- **report/**:
  - `docs/`: Final project report (PDF/LaTeX).
  - `presentation/`: Slides and demo video.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**.
2.  **Install dependencies**: (Add instructions later)
3.  **Run preprocessing**: Use scripts in `src/preprocessing/`.
4.  **Train model**: Use scripts in `src/training/`.
